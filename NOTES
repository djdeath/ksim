* GEM/Stub

** Handle userptr

** Handle DRM_IOCTL_VERSION

* Stages

** Geometry

** Tesselation

** Compute

* Fixed function

** Depth buffers

Add various depth tests, support all formats, do HiZ.

** Stencil

** Blending

* Thread pool

* JIT

** JIT in ps thread setup code

We can generate code to copy in the exact payload we'll need. Also
compile in depth test. Maybe even entire tile level loop to avoid
function pointer dispatch per SIMD8 group.

** Optimize rt write

** Track constants per sub reg (use case: msg headers)

** Detect constant offset ubo loads and just replace the send with loading the constant

* WM

** Use AVX2

** Subpixel precision

** Perspective correct barycentric

** Multi-sample

** Lines, points

* EU

** All the instructions

** Indirect addressing

** Control flow

** Write masks

Can ignore outside control flow, inside control flow we can use avx2
blend to implement write masking.

** Execution size greater than 8
